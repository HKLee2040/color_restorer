# color_restorer
It is a python implemenation of [Wide-Band Color Imagery Restoration for RGB-NIR Single Sensor Images](http://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/18/7/2059)
in Tensorflow 1.8.

Multi-spectral RGB-NIR sensors have become ubiquitous in recent years.
 These sensors allow the visible and near-infrared spectral bands of a
  given scene to be captured at the same time. With such cameras, the 
  acquired imagery has a compromised RGB color representation due to 
  near-infrared bands (700–1100 nm) cross-talking with the visible bands 
  (400–700 nm). This paper proposes two deep learning-based architectures 
  to recover the full RGB color images, thus removing the NIR information 
  from the visible bands. The proposed approaches directly restore the 
  high-resolution RGB image by means of convolutional neural networks. 
  They are evaluated with several outdoor images; both architectures reach 
  a similar performance when evaluated in different scenarios and using 
  different similarity metrics.
